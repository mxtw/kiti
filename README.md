`kiti` is a tool to set your wallpaper to a random image from
various sources written in Go.

So far setting the wallpaper is only supported using `feh` or `swaybg`

## Installation
```shell
go install github.com/mxtw/kiti@latest
```
You will need to have `feh` (X11) or `swaybg` (Wayland) to set the wallpaper.
